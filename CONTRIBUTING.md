## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MinecraftPipes.git
   cd MinecraftPipes
   ```

2. **Install MDL (Minecraft Datapack Language)**
   ```bash

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** to the MDL files
2. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash

   ```
3. **Test in Minecraft**:
   - Copy the built datapack to your test world

- Include **code examples** where helpful
- Update **both README and docs** when adding features
