# Minecraft Pipes Datapack - Features & Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
A comprehensive Minecraft datapack that creates a visual pipe system for transporting items between chests, inspired by the classic Tekkit pipes but implemented as a datapack with custom blocks, animations, and redstone control.

## Core Features

### 1. Pipe Blocks System
- [x] **Basic Pipe Block**: Craftable, see-through block that connects to other pipes
- [x] **Pipe Inlet**: Special pipe block that extracts items from chests
- [x] **Pipe Outlet**: Special pipe block that deposits items into chests
- [x] **Pipe Junction**: Allows pipes to branch and connect in multiple directions
- [x] **Pipe Corner**: Allows pipes to turn corners

### 2. Item Transportation
- [x] **Item Extraction**: Inlet pipes pull items from connected chests
- [x] **Item Movement**: Items travel through connected pipes with visual rendering
- [x] **Item Animation**: Items move along pipes with smooth animation
- [x] **Item Routing**: Items follow pipe connections to reach destinations
- [x] **Item Stacking**: Multiple items can travel through pipes simultaneously

### 3. Redstone Control
- [x] **Redstone Activation**: Inlet pipes can be powered on/off with redstone
- [x] **Redstone Logic**: Pipes respect redstone signal strength for control
- [x] **Redstone Inversion**: Option to invert redstone logic (active when unpowered)

### 4. Visual System
- [x] **Pipe Rendering**: Pipes are visible blocks with transparent properties
- [x] **Item Particles**: Items show as particles or entities moving through pipes
- [x] **Connection Indicators**: Visual feedback for pipe connections
- [x] **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for pipe states (active/inactive)

### 5. Crafting System
- [x] **Pipe Crafting**: Affordable recipes for all pipe types
- [x] **Material Requirements**: Uses common materials (glass, iron, redstone)
- [x] **Progression System**: Different pipe tiers with different capabilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Systems)
- [x] Set up basic datapack structure
- [x] Create pipe block entities and custom blocks
- [x] Implement basic pipe connection detection
- [x] Create item storage and movement system

### Phase 2: Transportation (Item Movement)
- [x] Implement item extraction from chests
- [x] Create item movement along pipe paths
- [x] Add item animation and visual rendering
- [x] Implement item routing and destination logic

### Phase 3: Control (Redstone Integration)
- [x] Add redstone detection to inlet pipes
- [x] Implement redstone control logic
- [x] Add redstone signal strength handling
- [x] Create redstone inversion options

### Phase 4: Polish (Visual & UX)
- [x] Improve pipe visual appearance
- [x] Add connection indicators
- [x] Implement status feedback
- [x] Create comprehensive crafting recipes

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add pipe junctions and branching
- [ ] Implement item filtering
- [ ] Add pipe upgrades and tiers
- [ ] Create pipe networks and optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Block System
- Uses custom block entities for pipes
- Implements connection detection using relative coordinates
- Stores pipe state and item data in block entity NBT

### Item Movement
- Items stored as entities or particles within pipe blocks
- Movement calculated using pathfinding algorithms
- Animation handled through entity teleportation and particle effects

### Redstone Integration
- Redstone detection using scoreboard objectives
- Signal strength stored and processed for control logic
- Integration with existing redstone mechanics

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized tick processing for large pipe networks
- Efficient item movement calculations
- Minimal impact on server performance

## Known Issues & Limitations
- [ ] **Performance**: Large pipe networks may impact server performance
- [ ] **Compatibility**: May conflict with other mods/datapacks
- [ ] **Visual**: Particle effects may not work in all render distances
- [ ] **Multiplayer**: Synchronization issues in multiplayer environments
