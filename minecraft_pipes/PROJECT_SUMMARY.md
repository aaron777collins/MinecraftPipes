# Minecraft Pipes Datapack - Project Summary

## 🎉 Project Complete!

I have successfully created a comprehensive Minecraft datapack that implements a visual pipe system for transporting items between chests, inspired by the classic Tekkit pipes. Here's what has been delivered:

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Pipe System
- **Basic Pipes**: Transparent glass blocks that connect to transport items
- **Inlet Pipes**: Red-tinted pipes that extract items from chests (redstone controlled)
- **Outlet Pipes**: Blue-tinted pipes that deposit items into chests
- **Pipe Junctions**: Yellow-tinted pipes for branching networks
- **Automatic Connections**: Pipes automatically detect and connect to adjacent pipes

### Item Transportation
- **Visual Item Movement**: Items travel through pipes as visible entities
- **Smooth Animation**: Items move every 2 ticks for smooth visual flow
- **Automatic Routing**: Items find the shortest path to destinations
- **Multiple Items**: Up to 4 items can travel through each pipe simultaneously
- **Chest Integration**: Automatic detection of adjacent chests for input/output

### Redstone Control
- **Redstone Activation**: Inlet pipes require redstone power to extract items
- **Signal Strength**: Redstone power level controls extraction speed
- **Automatic Detection**: Redstone signals are checked every 10 ticks
- **Flexible Control**: Can be configured for inverted logic if needed

### Crafting System
- **Affordable Recipes**: Uses common materials (glass, iron, redstone, hopper)
- **Multiple Pipe Types**: Different recipes for each pipe type
- **Custom Names**: Pipes have descriptive names and colors
- **Progression**: Basic pipes → Inlet/Outlet → Advanced pipes

### Visual System
- **Custom Textures**: Resource pack with custom pipe models
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different pipe types
- **Transparent Design**: See-through pipes with metallic rims
- **Item Particles**: Visual feedback for items moving through pipes

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Processing**: Pipe networks processed every 4 ticks
- **Entity Management**: Automatic cleanup of visual entities
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal impact on server performance
- **Scalable**: Works with both small and large pipe networks

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Install the Datapack**:
   ```bash
   # Copy dist folder to your world's datapacks directory
   # Or use the built dist.zip file
   ```

2. **Load in Game**:
   ```bash
   /reload
   ```

3. **Test the System**:
   ```bash
   /function pipes:test_help
   /function pipes:test_setup
   ```

### Basic Usage
1. **Create Pipes**:
   ```bash
   /function pipes:create_pipe          # Basic pipe
   /function pipes:create_inlet_pipe    # Inlet pipe
   /function pipes:create_outlet_pipe   # Outlet pipe
   ```

2. **Connect to Chests**:
   - Place inlet pipes next to source chests
   - Place outlet pipes next to destination chests
   - Pipes automatically detect adjacent chests

3. **Power the System**:
   - Provide redstone power to inlet pipes
   - Watch items flow through the network!
